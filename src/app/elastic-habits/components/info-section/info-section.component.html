    <p class="mb-3">Elastic Habits is a powerful habit tracking system designed for flexibility and consistency. Unlike traditional habit trackers that only offer binary completion options, Elastic Habits provides three difficulty levels for each habit:</p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-4">
      <div class="p-3 bg-gray-700 rounded">
        <div class="mb-2 px-2 py-1 rounded bg-green-600 text-white text-xs inline-block">Mini</div>
        <p class="text-sm">The easiest version of your habit, perfect for busy days or when your energy is low. It's designed to maintain consistency even in challenging circumstances.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-3 bg-gray-700 rounded">
        <div class="mb-2 px-2 py-1 rounded bg-blue-600 text-white text-xs inline-block">Plus</div>
        <p class="text-sm">The standard version of your habit for normal days. This represents your default target when conditions are favorable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-3 bg-gray-700 rounded">
        <div class="mb-2 px-2 py-1 rounded bg-red-600 text-white text-xs inline-block">Elite</div>
        <p class="text-sm">The challenging version for when you want to push yourself. This is your stretch goal that promotes growth and excellence.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Benefits of Elastic Habits</h3>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-1 text-sm">
      <li>Greater flexibility adapts to your energy levels and schedule</li>
      <li>Increased consistency by removing the all-or-nothing approach</li>
      <li>Progressive improvement through optional challenge levels</li>
      <li>Customizable to your specific needs with day-specific scheduling</li>
      <li>Better resilience against habit breaking due to multiple completion options</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">This approach was developed by Stephen Guise, author of "Elastic Habits," as an evolution of his "Mini Habits" system. It combines consistency with adaptability to create sustainable behavior change.</p>
